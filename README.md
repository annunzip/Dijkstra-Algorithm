# Dijkstra Algorithm
This program, implemented in Java, is for Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm which finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph

## What I did for this program: 
For this program, I wrote the graph method which creates a new graph based off of input nodes and edges, as well as designing and implementing the method for Dijkstra's algorithm given two nodes.
